            Accomplished people from around the world have led our great association in its over 100-year history.
            While each international president brings a unique perspective and expertise to Lions Clubs International,
            there has (and always will be) a single constant that unites all Lions: service. With this as a guide, each
            president is committed to helping clubs increase their service, and as a result, their impact on our local
            and global communities.

            <b>Dear Lion,</b><br />
            Growing up in my home country of Iceland has helped shape who I am today. It is a small but beautiful
            country with tight-knit communities of people who rely on each other and work together to meet new
            challenges. Just like Lions. This spirit of unity is a cornerstone of our motto and my presidential theme,
            “We Serve.”
            We serve the world, our local communities, our neighbors and each other with unmatched kindness and pride.
            We are a global force for good with a century of experience and compassion. When we channel the power of
            more than 1.4 million Lions, we can reach new horizons of service together.
            We can do it by finding creative solutions to the challenges facing our communities. We can achieve more
            when we embrace new technologies. We can go further than we’ve ever gone before when we invite caring men
            and women to join us in service. It’s true, we have achieved so much in our first 100 years, but together
            we can unlock our true potential in our communities and around the world.
            When we embrace our ambitious future together, we will serve in a way the world has never seen before. It
            will be my honor to stand side by side with you as we serve beyond the horizon.
            In friendship,
            <br />
            <b>Gudrun Yngvadottir</b>
